# Nano-Graphene: AI-Driven Nanopore Design for Water Desalination

\

## Overview

**Nano-Graphene** is a research-focused project combining **deep reinforcement learning (DRL)** and **convolutional neural networks (CNNs)** to **design optimized graphene nanopores for water desalination**. The project aims to automate nanopore structure generation to maximize **water flux** while minimizing **ion rejection**, which is critical for effective desalination.

This repository integrates content from the original project README, including pre-existing **usage instructions, dataset descriptions, and model files**.

**Key Contributions:**

* DRL for nanopore growth control
* CNN-based property prediction
* Multi-objective optimization for water flux and ion rejection
* Dataset of nanopore geometries with corresponding performance metrics

## Scientific Intuition & Motivation

Designing nanoporous graphene for desalination is challenging due to:

* **Complex structure-property relationships**: Small changes in pore geometry drastically affect water and ion transport
* **High-dimensional design space**: Millions of possible atomic configurations
* **Experimental cost**: Synthesizing and testing nanopores is time-consuming and expensive

**Our Approach:**

* Use **CNNs** to predict key performance metrics (water flux and ion rejection) from nanopore geometries
* Use **DRL agents** to propose structural modifications for optimal performance
* Feedback loop ensures **iterative improvement** of nanopore designs without exhaustive experimentation

**Benefits:**

* Accelerates nanopore design
* Reduces reliance on expensive simulations or experiments
* Enables **multi-objective optimization** with automated trade-off management
* Demonstrates the potential of AI-driven materials engineering

## Technical Details

### 1. CNN Model for Property Prediction

* Input: Graphene nanopore structure (2D atomic map or 3D coordinates)
* Output: Water flux and ion rejection metrics
* Architecture: Convolutional layers extract spatial patterns, fully connected layers output predicted properties
* Purpose: Provides **fast evaluation** of nanopore designs for DRL agent

### 2. Deep Reinforcement Learning Agent

* Controls **pore growth actions** (adding/removing atoms)
* Reward function balances:

  * Maximizing water flux
  * Maximizing ion rejection
  * Penalty for non-physical or unstable configurations
* Policy: DRL optimizes sequential decisions for nanopore construction

### 3. Workflow

1. Initialize base graphene structure
2. CNN predicts performance of initial pore
3. DRL agent proposes modifications
4. CNN evaluates new structure
5. Reward is computed and agent updates policy
6. Steps 3-5 repeat iteratively to improve nanopore design
7. Optimized nanopore structures are saved for analysis and potential fabrication

### 4. Dataset

* Includes nanopore PDB files and performance CSVs (from the original README)
* Used for CNN training and DRL evaluation
* Contains geometric features and corresponding water/ion transport data

### 5. Multi-Objective Optimization

* DRL agent simultaneously optimizes water flux and ion rejection
* Uses weighted reward function or Pareto-front approach
* Enables trade-off exploration between throughput and selectivity
